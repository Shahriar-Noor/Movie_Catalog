# Movie_Catalog
Background: I created this application to check my understanding of programming an interface where users can interact with a database to store and retrieve
data. This interface was made by utilizing different ADO.NET controls.

This application interacts with a Microsoft Access database that has a single table (for simplicity, please check this project ->  for a database with multiple tables) with fields for movie title, year, genre, and rating. The program contains a navigation
toolbar that has buttons to scroll through the records, add a new record, delete a record, search for a specific movie by title and save the database.
